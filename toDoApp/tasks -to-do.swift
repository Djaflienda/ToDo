// 1. Change storyBoard segue from ToDoeeList disclosure indicator to ItemDetailViewController
//Using tableView delegate method - accessoryButtonTappedForRowWith
//DONE DONE DONE

//2. This app has a bug - when 'swipe to delete' gesture was performed, view state becomes editing.
//But if User tapped Edit/Done button, setEditing method triggers twice - problem discribed inside the code

//3. Where should I save information about amount of ToDoee in each category???

//4. What if user creates two or more categories with the same name?
